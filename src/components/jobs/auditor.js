          Candidates should have a strong understanding of security primitives
          and be up-to-date with current exploits. Awareness of the current
          DeFi landscape is a big plus, and experience with exploitation techniques
          of financial protocols is a valued skill. You should also be aware
          of how the EVM works, and the idiosyncrasies which can lead to vulnerabilities
          when developers donâ€™t properly understand them. You will have the opportunity
          to work with and learn from some of the brightest minds in the space,
          to see how we approach hacking, threat modelling, scanning, auditing,
          designing and enhancing the security of smart contracts across the board.

          Alongside client work, we also provide you with plenty of time for
          research and development efforts where you can push the state of the
          art and science of blockchain security.

          Most of the work can be done remotely from wherever you are; little
          travel is anticipated (most of the team works remotely around the world).
          Along with a focus on technical excellence, we also believe firmly that
          culture and processes play an essential role in security.
